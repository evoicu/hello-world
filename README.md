# hello-world

I am trying to learn how to code. Why should I learn how to code? I think it will help me get interesting, better paid jobs that I will enjoy. It's also a skill you can constantly develop, and it's good to have something you can build on as an ongoing personal development project. I might be mixing concepts here, but I think personal development is everything that makes you a better person, being going to the gym, learning a new language or getting to know your emotions..
